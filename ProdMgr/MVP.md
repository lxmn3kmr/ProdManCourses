Minimum Viable Product. Prototype. 
Actually it is more of a process. Validated learning. Testing hypothesis. Does not bias customer. 
mitigate risk. save resources. 

kind of experiment to know if customers are interested in new product/feature we are building.

3 critical things: Time, Money and Opportunity cost 

**7 Steps to Do MVP**
1. what the problem is and solution set.
2. assumptions associated with problem/soultion set. find the riskiest.
3. building hypothesis around assumption
4. Establish minimum criteria to success MCS
5. picking what type of MVP you run and your strategy
6. executing the MVP experiment
7. evaluating and learning from exp


2. Anything we know is an **assumption**. In order for my idea to be successful following must be true. 
  eg. for google glass. assume people will have camera on the face. 
      for online learning - paying money for online courses
    my customer has xyz problems, 
__ matters to my customer, --> 30 min dominos delivery - pizza is good when you eat soon (marketing), don't care about resolution earlier but now 1080p TV.
___will pay for it,  
no satisfactory substitutes  --> feature phone to smartphone

Zirx:
 problem: Hard to park your car in big cities.
        hard to find garages, incovenient, expensive
solution: on demand valet app
 assumptions: not enough parking, incovenient, expensive, car parkers care about price, convenience, 
don't care about speed(waiting), not satisfied with garage, enough drivers have smartphone, drivers operate phone while driving,
would people want to work as on demand valet, people will trust giving car to valet.

Find the riskiest: usually is - customer having a xyz problem. 
Risk vs Difficulty matrix. Difficulty in validating assumption/buildin mvp

**Hypothesis** - People are not satisfied with parking. No. Be specific. Who are not satisfied. why they are not.
  Assumption vs Hypothesis. Hypothesis is actionable. 
  Target group,
  Potential problem, 
  Action, 
  Expected outcome
**Simple**: We belive _____ will _____ because _____
 If we ____ we believe ____ will ____ because ___
**PM Way** We believe ____ has a ____ because ____ . If we ___ this ___ will improve. Always be more specific.


**MCS**:
  Cost of changing vs Reward 
  Cost - X feature - dev time, pm time, wages, advertising cost, brand effect, legacy issues, Opportunity cost. 
Rewards - metrics - increased revenue, time spent on page, likes, etc.

Calculate cost, and also what else can be built in that time/money. Opportunity Cost. 
calculate rewards in revenue  and compare.

Startups: Validation metrics - good idea, meet user needs, problem exist, % increase in sign up, avg purchase price, people open your emails, 

economic viablity. 

**Techniques**
  Email MVP - send emails
  Shadow MVP - create a feature related button. Once cliked registers for the feature, or shows coming soon.  startups use to triage nice to have features, eg: login with linkedin, google, fb etc. fake buttons to gauge interest
  404 page - Amazon uses it extensively. categories of products, new projects etc.
  coming soon page -  pre order page, 
  Explainer MVP - tutorial videos and sales related videos. Eg: Dropbox used this. Founder uploaded fake video of saving files to cloud. People showed interest. Sales related - some video editor with features etc asking to sign up for notification. 
  Fake landing page 
  Landing page Pitch experiment - online experiment, you pitch to online audience. Use Landing pages. Create fake landing pages to gauge interest. Even for a feature/product to drive internal traffic or external.
  Concierge service MVP - launch product to subset of users. new thing, manually help them. first hand experience. ask for recommendations. eg: amazon launching new bot service, rent the runway dress rentals, 
  piecemeal MVP - use small softwares to stitch your product to test it. formstack, typeform, jotform, twilio, recurly. Eg: groupon uses this. bombarded with emails with diff products. they created site on wordpress 
  Wizard of Oz MVP - manually done at backend. let's say fb feature for matching interest people - instead of building algo, manually update them at backend. eg: Zappos. shoe seller but did not had shoes inventory.
