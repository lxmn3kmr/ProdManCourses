Minimum Viable Product. Prototype. 
Actually it is more of a process. Validated learning. Testing hypothesis. Does not bias customer. 
mitigate risk. save resources. 

kind of experiment to know if customers are interested in new product/feature we are building.

3 critical things: Time, Money and Opportunity cost 

7 Steps to Do MVP
1. what the problem is and solution set.
2. assumptions associated with problem/soultion set. find the riskiest.
3. building hypothesis around assumption
4. Establish minimum criteria to success MCS
5. picking what type of MVP you run and your strategy
6. executing the MVP experiment
7. evaluating and learning from exp


2. Anything we know is an assumption. In order for my idea to be successful following must be true. 
  eg. for google glass. assume people will have camera on the face. 
      for online learning - paying money for online courses
    my customer has xyz problems, 
__ matters to my customer, --> 30 min dominos delivery - pizza is good when you eat soon (marketing), don't care about resolution earlier but now 1080p TV.
___will pay for it,  
no satisfactory substitutes  --> feature phone to smartphone

Zirx:
 problem: Hard to park your car in big cities.
        hard to find garages, incovenient, expensive
solution: on demand valet app
 assumptions: not enough parking, incovenient, expensive, car parkers care about price, convenience, 
don't care about speed(waiting), not satisfied with garage, enough drivers have smartphone, drivers operate phone while driving,
would people want to work as on demand valet, people will trust giving car to valet.

Find the riskiest:
