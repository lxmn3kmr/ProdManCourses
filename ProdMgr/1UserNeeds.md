**Getting real user needs**
Understand core problem not whatever user asks. 
Being a product manager is all about finding a solution to a problem instead of trying to fit a problem to a solution that you or someone else has thought of in the first place. 
Ask Why do we need to do this? WHy? Why? to identify the core problem. 
Is this solving actual problem? If we do this exactly as they ask is this going to have any side effects?
Eg: twitter. ask - to cover retweets. consequences. 

Users and Customers. - Macrolevel feedback from directors etc. Daily usage from users.
